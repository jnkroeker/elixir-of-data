## Description

Implementation of the data processing pipeline with Elixir tutorial provided here:

https://semaphoreci.com/blog/data-pipelines-elixir?utm_source=Blog+Newsletter&utm_campaign=14212ebe0f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_MAR_16_2023&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2c1357b8be-14212ebe0f-116468936

This project could be extended or modified for any data processing project.

The primary objective of completing this tutorial at this time is understanding the trade offs with other systems.
